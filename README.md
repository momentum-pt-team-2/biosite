## Biosite 

### This is a Django practice app that will render bios and work samples for the class

### TODO for each student
- Remember to work in a branch
    ` git checkout -b <branch name>`
- Create a url, view, and template specific to you.
   - You have access to the user model to render
   - In your view, remember to get *your* user object
- Name the url after yourself
- Option to include quote, weather info, or other data from external API
- Style your page, perhaps using css frameworks. Helpful to sketch it out first.
- Some things to include: short bio/objective, work samples, contact me link/form
